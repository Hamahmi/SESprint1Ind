After downloading the back end portion of the project you should run both commands in the cmd:
[npm install may not be needed if you cloned the node modules]

```
  npm install
  npm start
```

  After which you can proceed to downloading the front end and running these commands:
  [same as above for npm install]
```
  npm install
  ng serve 
```

  Now if you visit http://localhost:4200 on your browser you should have a functioning replica of our project :).
